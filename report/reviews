Review 1:

Overall, the game is fun and tense, and has a significant observable skill ceiling with a relatively low skill floor. Turning speeds seem quite slow, which may be down to game balance, but makes pivoting in-place cumbersome, and slows down the otherwise fast pace of the game. Another minor note would be that transforming from the weight to the ship results in a ship pointing downwards and descending at quite the rate, making recovery without nearby tether-able objects difficult. The powerups create incentive for fast and controlled movement around the map.


Review 2:

The game is fun and I like how well the laws of physics are developed. Bouncing instead of taking damage from lasers feels very original. The controls feel a bit awkward. Making turns was unexpectedly hard. Perhaps a different selection for keys would be better. I liked the changing shapes of the ships with the different properties.
